Here classification is done for images of two classes: Dog and Cat.

Implementation:

1. Extracting the TinyImages features for each training and testing image for which we need to resize the image to the size 32 x 32.

2. Running 2 classifiers: K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and Neural Networks (NN) on the testing images.
